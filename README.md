rocket_fsm_FINAL in Rocket cpp folder is the final working code for the rocket control

Sim3dot0 in Rocket Simulink folder is the final simulation code; para_sim1dot7 needs to be loaded first

Note: Dynamic damping is not modelled in the simulation, leading to an overdamped system in a real scenario.
